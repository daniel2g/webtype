            Stephie is 7 years old. She likes bugs, books and spaghetti. Her favourite thing to do is to stay up late and watch scary movies. Also, she’s a girl...which should be pretty easy to understand, right? Well, not for her dad! He’s been mistaking her for a boy since she was born and struggles to see her as who she is. But other people don’t have a say in what it means to be ourselves, even when we love them.
