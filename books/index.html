            A bibliography of transgender and nonbinary representation in picture books
        </p>
            
            Children’s books can be great at pointing out what we take for granted. They can introduce children to new worlds, and can lead adults to consider the ideas handed down to them. Queer texts, specifically, are powerful for giving a glimpse into what underlies our beliefs, and having access to diverse stories can be a catalyst for personal (and societal) evolution, regardless of a reader’s acclimation to hearing about gender.
            <br><br>
            I chose books that challenge normative, dominant, or stereotypical representations. This doesn’t mean expanding what is considered normal, but instead rejecting the need for normativity. I chose books that prove anything is possible for oneself or for others, introducing readers to important words like “transgender” and “nonbinary.”

            Nobody seems to understand that Hannah is not a girl. His parents ask why he won’t wear the cute outfits they pick out. His friend thinks he must be a tomboy. His teacher insists he should be proud to be a girl. But a birthday wish, a new word, and a stroke of courage might be just what Hannah needs to finally show the world who he really is.

            Stephie is 7 years old. She likes bugs, books and spaghetti. Her favourite thing to do is to stay up late and watch scary movies. Also, she’s a girl...which should be pretty easy to understand, right? Well, not for her dad! He’s been mistaking her for a boy since she was born and struggles to see her as who she is. But other people don’t have a say in what it means to be ourselves, even when we love them.
