            A bibliography of transgender and nonbinary representation in picture books
        </p>
            
            Children’s books can be great at pointing out what we take for granted. They can introduce children to new worlds, and can lead adults to consider the ideas handed down to them. Queer texts, specifically, are powerful for giving a glimpse into what underlies our beliefs, and having access to diverse stories can be a catalyst for personal (and societal) evolution, regardless of a reader’s acclimation to hearing about gender.
            <br><br>
            I chose books that challenge normative, dominant, or stereotypical representations. This doesn’t mean expanding what is considered normal, but instead rejecting the need for normativity. I chose books that prove anything is possible for oneself or for others, introducing readers to important words like “transgender” and “nonbinary.”
